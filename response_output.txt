1.  What  Exactly  ARE  Large  Language  Models  (LLMs)?  
Okay,  so  LLMs  are  basically  these  very  advanced  AI  programs  that  are  designed  to  understand,  
create,
 
and
 
chat
 
in
 
human
 
language.
 
Why
 
do
 
we
 
call
 
them
 
"large"?
 
Well,
 
it's
 
because
 
they
 
have
 
billions,
 
or
 
even
 
trillions,
 
of
 
tiny
 
little
 
"parameters"
 
inside.
 
Think
 
of
 
those
 
as
 
all
 
the
 
pieces
 
of
 
information
 
the
 
AI
 
learns
 
when
 
it's
 
being
 
trained.

at
 
handling
 
information
 
that
 
comes
 
in
 
a
 
sequence,
 
like
 
words
 
in
 
a
 
sentence.
 ●  Lots  of  Training  Data:  LLMs  get  trained  on  a  huge  amount  of  text  data  from  all  over  the  
internet.
 
We're
 
talking
 
books,
 
articles,
 
websites,
 
and
 
even
 
everyday
 
conversations.
 
All
 
this
 
information
 
helps
 
them
 
learn
 
how
 
language
 
works,
 
grammar
 
rules,
 
facts,
 
how
 
to
 
solve
 
problems,
 
and
 
even
 
the
 
subtle
 
ways
 
people

as
 
all
 
the
 
pieces
 
of
 
information
 
the
 
AI
 
learns
 
when
 
it's
 
being
 
trained.
 
How  These  AI  Programs  Do  Their  Job:  
●  Neural  Network  Basics:  At  their  core,  LLMs  are  just  really  complicated  "neural  
networks."
 
They're
 
usually
 
built
 
using
 
something
 
called
 
the
 
"Transformer"
 
architecture,
 
which
 
is
 
just
 
super
 
good
 
at
 
handling
 
information
 
that
 
comes
 
in
 
a
 
sequence,
 
like
 
words
 
in
 
a
 
sentence.
